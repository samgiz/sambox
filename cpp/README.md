All things C++ go here.

# Main goals

* Using modern C++ features (C++20 and above). In particular modules, ranges and concepts.
* Good docs.
* Easy debugging. Easy logging of data structures, tracing algorithms and visualizing algorithms.
* Performance tests comparing against existing implementations (and my own implementations in other languages).

# Maybe goals

* Have a way to submit code to competitive programming libraries (so a script to combine multiple files into one).
