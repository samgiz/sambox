# Sambox

This is a monorepo for me to practice creating libraries (in C++ to start with, but I intend to try out other languages as well).

All code in this repository is experimental and is subject to change at any point without warning.

## Contributions

I don't encourage making PRs as this is very much a repository for me to experiment and learn new tools / concepts / languages. If you find bugs or obvious improvements though, I will accept them. :)
